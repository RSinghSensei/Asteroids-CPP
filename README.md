# Asteroids Version 1.2

Asteroids made in **C++** using **OpenGL** and **GLFW**. 

## **Version 1.2** - LATEST
- State switches for menu, gave over screen (state design pattern)
- Lives/Health symbols
- Enemy, but I have to fix the code for its shooting mecahnics. It has collisions but the shooting direction needs some touch up
- Lots of file restructuring and OOP-fying my code :)
- More audio
- Another video, enable sound 
- Restart game mechanic is present, and it works the first two times but magically fails the third, will try to fix this up

TO DO:
- Multiplayer Time!
- Remove a lot of commented code, and some more OOP-fying
